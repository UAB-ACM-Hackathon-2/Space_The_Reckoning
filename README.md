This game is kind of like space invadors. You use 'a' and 'd' to move side to side and use the spacebar to 
shoot your weapon. You lose points if the spaceships get passed you. Some of the enemies will let extra point
orbs drop and they give you 5 extra points when collected while regular enemy kills give you only 1 point.
Every now and then a Boss will appear and he requires 10 hits to be killed. When you lose you go to another screen 
and Your points will be shown to you and you can chose to play the game again if you want to.

This is manly a survivor game to see how long you can last.

--TroubleShooting
If when you try to open the file and it says that The app can't be open because it is from an unidentified person or signer or something like that, just open up the System Preferences and go to the Security and Privacy section and under "Allow apps downloaded from" there will be a thing that list the app and a button beside it that says "open anyway" press that and it should work or show one more window which you will have to press okay and then the game should start and it should be playable from then on and you won't have to do this again.
