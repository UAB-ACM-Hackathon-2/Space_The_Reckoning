This game is kind of like space invadors. You use 'a' and 'd' to move side to side and use the spacebar to 
shoot your weapon. You lose points if the spaceships get passed you. Some of the enemies will let extra point
orbs drop and they give you 5 extra points when collected while regular enemy kills give you only 1 point.
Every now and then a Boss will appear and he requires 10 hits to be killed. When you lose you go to another screen 
and Your points will be shown to you and you can chose to play the game again if you want to.

This is manly a survivor game to see how long you can last.
